    <h1>My Anti-Racism Work</h1>
    <h3>Hi there, my name is Nikki</h3>
    <p>
      and I've created this site to track my daily Anti-Racism work and thought
      I would publish it in case it was at all helpful for others.

        <strong>My daughters school </strong> I reached out to my daugheters
        administrations to start the first steps in actions towards change. I
        posted in the parents WhatsApp group on June 2nd and emailed the Vice
        Principal.

      <li>
        <strong>My coding school </strong> I slack messaged General Assembly's
        Melbourne based Manager. I went to school there and asked if she would
        consider matching tuition for a black student if I raised the funds.
