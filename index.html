        <li>2020 July 24 - Instagrammed. Twittered. Fairly emotionally exhausting day as I spoke up in an early morning meeting about the term "grooming" possibly being racist (by mistake) in front of a group of 40 people.

        <li>2020 July 28 - Got called out on Instagram for a post I shared about Appropriation vs. Assimilation, I mentioned I had just learned about Beyonce and skin lightening (assimilation). Beyonce hasn't said she's done this and a lot of photographers will lighten skin without permission so it's not appropriate to say it. I corrected myself publicly. Listened to The New Jim Crow. Reached out to someone at work about the user testing and feedback sessions and asked if we were accounting for race and sexual orientation which they weren't.

      <h4>Questions to explore</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>What should media representation look like?</li>
        <li>How should companies aim or track their racial equity in their company?</li>
        <li>What's the difference between being a white ally and a white savior?</li>
        <li>When I hear Black people talk about how they're proud to be Black I think about how ashamed I am to be white. I feel like if I was proud to be white I would be a white supremist. I wonder if I should strive to be proud or just accept my whiteness.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>Questions Answered</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Should white people use the white emoji or the yellow simpson?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After learning that white people think that yellow simpson is default, but white people always think they're the the default I learned that acknowledging my whiteness is good. Although I'm not neccessarily proud of being white, I understand that I need to accept it to move forward in the world acknowledging my privilege and how that relates to other races.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Can white people use the "👌" or has this been taken over by white nationalists?</li>
          <ul>
            <li> 
              After reading this NYT article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/us/ok-sign-white-power.html" target="_blank">When the O.K. Sign Is No Longer O.K.</a>, I polled my instagram audience and 70% of them said that we shouldn't be using it. Which makes me incredibly sad. However, a follower of mine said <a href="https://www.idlesband.com/uk" target="_blank">Idles</a>, which is a anti-fascist and anti-racist band is trying to take it back. In the meantime I'll refrain from using it myself.

            <h6>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h6>
             Clyde ross was born in 1923, the seventh of 13 children, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, the home of the blues. Ross’s parents owned and farmed a 40-acre tract of land, flush with cows, hogs, and mules. Ross’s mother would drive to Clarksdale to do her shopping in a horse and buggy, in which she invested all the pride one might place in a Cadillac. The family owned another horse, with a red coat, which they gave to Clyde. The Ross family wanted for little, save that which all black families in the Deep South then desperately desired—the protection of the law.

            “I recently learned from (group of people) that (the behavior/belief/etc) is (dangerous/harmful/whatever) so now I (don’t do that anymore/do this other thing instead). I’m here to talk more about this if you want to.” The example I give in the video is a simple one about language but you could use this format to initiate conversation for much bigger issues as well. For example:
            <br>
            I learned from Black feminist scholars that police reform actually gives even more power to the police, so now I understand that police abolition is what’s important. I’m available to talk more about this if you want to.
            <br>
            Talking to each other isn’t all there is to do in terms of fighting systemic oppression, but it is a part of it, and one that many white people find ourselves woefully ill equipped for. Building communication skills can be one relevant part of your strategy.
